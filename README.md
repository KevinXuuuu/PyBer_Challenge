## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this challenge is to use both Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
At the end of the challenge, we would be able to see how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results: 
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)

## Summary: 
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
