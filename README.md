## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this challenge is to use both Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
At the end of the challenge, we would be able to see how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results:

In terms of the total fare by city type, as the multiple line graph above.
We could concludes that the Urban have the greatest total fare amount the 3 city, Suburban 2nd, and Rural last.
Yet, this doesn't mean anything other than reveue.
We have to look at it deeper, when we are looking at the average fare per Ride as the chart shown below.

We can easiely identify Rural has the highest average fare per ride, that's about 140% of the Urban average fare per ride. 
Yet, Rural have the lowest driver and number of rides among the three.

## Summary:
